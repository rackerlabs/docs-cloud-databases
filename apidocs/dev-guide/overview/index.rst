About the API
-----------------------------------------

The Rackspace Cloud Databases API service enables developers to 
easily provision database instances of varying virtual resource
sizes without the need to maintain and/or update the database engine through 
a simple Representational State Transfer (REST) web service interface.


The Rackspace Cloud Databases service is a fully managed database service based on Openstack.
