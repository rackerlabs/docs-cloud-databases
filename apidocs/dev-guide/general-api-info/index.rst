General API information
-------------------------

Ideas explained here are relevant to all operations of the API. See the API Operations chapter for details about specific operations.

The Rackspace Cloud Databases API is implemented using a ReSTful web service interface. Like other products in the Rackspace Cloud suite, the DB service shares a common token-based authentication system that allows seamless access between products and services.

.. note:: 
   
   All requests to authenticate against and operate the service are performed using
   SSL over HTTP (HTTPS) on TCP port 443.
